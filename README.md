## VisualTalk

#### This is a React-Native application for an image captioning project at [InOut 2018](https://hackinout.co).

It contains two major components: 
- Camera: A camera viewfinder with options to turn on the flash, flip the camera front-to-back, manual focus, and camera-zoom settings. It is capable of recognizing faces and contains a gallery with all taken pictures. 
- Chat: On taking a picture, the app pings an endpoint which provides the caption in an alert box. The user has the option to view the chat interface where a record of all recieved captions are contained. The user can follow up with questions about the same picture and the chat interface will contain the conversation.
